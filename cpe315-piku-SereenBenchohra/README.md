## Challenges on Lab 1
     
        The challenges that I had in Lab 1 was I was confused on why I could not use different 
      registers for each haiku line. I got a segmentation fault when I attempted to do so. In 
      additon, I did not fully understood how printf in assembly worked (it was not mentioned 
      in the reading) and how the load and the push pop were related to that. As a result, the
      lab took a lot longer than it needed to be.
