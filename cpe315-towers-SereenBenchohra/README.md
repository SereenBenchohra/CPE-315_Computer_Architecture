## Challenges on Lab 2
     
        The challenges that I had in Lab 2 was I was confused was on the stack and the application
        push since I though for a while that I had to use store, but I realized I did not need to.
        Also, I had some logical errors where I used inappropiate logic and it took a while to
        to figure out.
