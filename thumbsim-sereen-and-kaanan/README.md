# CPE 315 
## ARM Thumb Simulator

In this project you will build an ARM Thumb simulator to examine performance 
metrics of a given program. You are provided the support code for the 
simulator; you will complete the simulator and collect statistics with it.

## Tasks
The simulator should handle a subset of the ARM Thumb instruction set. The 
"Shang" benchmark on which you will do measurements has the following 
instructions that you must support: 

  * push
  * pop
  * sub (sp minus immediate)
  * sub (immediate)
  * sub (register)
  * add (sp plus register)
  * add (sp plus immediate)
  * add (register)
  * add (immediate)
  * cmp (register)
  * cmp (immediate)
  * mov (immediate)
  * mov (register)
  * str
  * strb
  * stmia
  * ldr
  * ldrb
  * ldr (literal)
  * ldmia
  * b (unconditional)
  * bcc
  * bcs
  * beq
  * bge
  * bhi
  * ble
  * bls
  * blt
  * bne
  * bl
  * lsl (immediate)
  * neg.

The byte memory operations are particularly tricky. The C++ implementation of 
the simulator only reads and writes memory on a word granularity (4 bytes at a 
time), so make sure you work within that constraint.

### Your tasks are as follows:
Complete the simulator so it successfully runs the fib and Shang benchmarks
(details below). The simulator, as provided, implements only a handful of 
instructions. You need to add support for other instructions.

You also need to collect statistics on the benchmark that you run to answer 
the questions in the writeup. Please measure dynamic (runtime) statistics for:
  * Number of instructions
  * Number of Memory Reads and Memory Writes (push, pop, ldm and stm count 1 for each register handled by the instruction).
  * Number of Conditional Branches, both forward and backward, taken and not taken in each direction. Do not include unconditional branches (including procedure calls or returns) as branches.
  * Cache performance. For a 256-byte direct-mapped cache, what is the best block (line) size in bytes? You could choose to have 64 entries in the cache of 4 bytes each, or instead 1 entry of 256 bytes, or anything in between. What has the best hit rate?

You will measure statistics for different optimization levels of the Shang 
benchmark. Example outputs from the instructor's simulator for the fib and 
shang benchmarks are included in the sample outputs directory. 

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll want to start with the "fib" test program that is supplied. It should 
return the (hex) value 59 in r0. However, when you first run it, it will fail 
because not all the instructions are implemented, and you should add those 
first until the program runs correctly. A complete output of thumbsim 
is included, along with the assembly file for fib.

Next, you will want to collect statistics and fix the Cache::access routine.
You should make sure your tool-flow works properly and have a working fib, 
without statistics, by the end of Week 1 of the project. You should have 
correct statistics including cache for fib and some of the additional 
instructions for shang by the end of Week 2 at the latest. If you don't meet 
these milestones, you're in danger of not finishing the assignment.
Deliverables

You have two deliverables. First, you will submit your source code through 
GitHub. You will also submit a one-page PDF writeup (no longer than one page!)
also through GitHub, that presents your conclusions to the following questions:
Base your answers on the statistics you gather from Shang.
  1. If you are building a processor and have to do static branch prediction (meaning you have to assume at compile time whether a branch is taken or not), how should you do it? You can make a different decision for branches that go forward or backward. 
  2. If you are building a 256-byte direct-mapped cache, what should you choose as your block (line) size?
  3. What conclusions can you draw about the differences between compiling with no optimization and -O2 optimization?

## Compiling ARM Thumb Programs
This process is rather involved, and involves the use of a Raspberry Pi. For 
now, use the provided files. When you need to generate your own test cases, 
  I will post detailed instructions on our Piazza page on how to create the 
  simulator input files.

## The Simulator
You get five source files (plus a header file). You should have to only 
modify three of them. Here is what they are and what you should do:

 - [ ] **decode.cpp** associates opcodes with their string equivalents, and 
 prints them if the flags are set. You will need to modify this file to 
 decode the new instructions you encounter. The purpose of decode is to print 
 instructions and to return the correct instruction types to the execute 
 function.
 - [ ] **execute.cpp** is the major file you should change. The simulator 
 calls execute() for each iteration representing an instruction, fetches the 
 current instruction, decodes and evaluates that instruction, changing the 
 machine state (the data memory dmem, the register file rf, and the program 
 counter pc). I have left a few instructions as examples in this file, 
 including some of the trickiest ones to implement. You need to fill in the 
 rest of the instructions and also capture all necessary statistics. 
 - [x] **main.cpp** contains the main routine and parses command-line 
 arguments which may be helpful in debugging:
  * -p dumps the parsed program at the start of the simulation.
  * -d dumps the contents of data memory (all non-zero data memory entries) and the register file after the end of the simulation.
  * -i prints every instruction as it executes.
  * -w prints every write to data memory.
  * -s prints statistics at the end of the program.
  * -c # (fill in # with a size in bytes) enables caches of size #. For this assignment, -c 256 is probably most appropriate.
  * -f simfilename runs the sim file specified. This option must be specified.
    You should not have to change this file.
 - [x] **parse.cpp** parses the sim file. You shouldn't need to change it.
 - [ ] **thumbsim\_driver.cpp** (and thumbsim.hpp) contain the core data 
  structures. You should only need to change one routine in this file, 
  Cache::access, which currently returns a cache miss (false) for every cache 
  access. You will need to enter tags into the cache ("entries") on a miss 
  and check tags on every access.

If you call "thumbsim -c 256" the system automatically instantiates several 
  caches: 256B, 4-byte cache lines; 256B, 8-byte cache lines, etc. 
  (up to 256B, 256-byte cache lines). Every time you access memory (ldr, str, 
  push, pop, etc.), YOU call caches.access(addr). The system automatically 
  calls Cache::access on each cache. YOU also need to write Caches::access(), 
  which 
    * Keeps track of cache tags (not data, not valid, ...)
    * Determines hit or miss
    * Keeps stats: hits++, misses++

  Start by typing 'make' to create the thumbsim executable.

## Grading
  This assignment is worth 80 points, divided as follows:
  * 10 points for Report and answers to questions
  * 10 points for correct Cache stats
  * 10 points for correct other stats
  * 10 points for fib
  * 20 points for Shang at O2 optimization
  * 10 points for Shang at O1 optimization
